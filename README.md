Group 13 - 32027 31080 Interactive Media 

## Overview
This project was created for the 32027 31080 Interactive Media course at UTS.  It is meant to help users easily visualize the flow of people entering and exiting Floor 1, 9 and 11 in UTS's Building 11 through a tree model.  As people enter a floor, leaves grow on the corresponding branch, and as they exit, leaves fall off that branch.

Our current project displays data recorded on Floor 1, 9, and 11 in UTS's Building 11 from Feburary 4-10, 2019.

## Features
**Filter Dates**
Users can set a beginning and end date (between Feb 4-10, 2019) using two dropdown menus to filter the data.

**Zoom**
Users can zoom in for a closer look at a specific floor (or branch) by selecting their preferred floor from a dropdown menu.  To view the entire graphic, the option 'All' may be selected from the dropdown menu to zoom back out.
